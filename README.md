# Telco Data Integration using IBM SPSS Modeler

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of multiple telecommunications datasets using IBM SPSS Modeler.
The workflow combines customer, call, product, and tariff data into one cohesive dataset for analysis and predictive modeling.

## Objective

To create a unified dataset by merging and cleansing data from different sources, improving consistency, and preparing it for advanced analytics.

## Tools and Datasets
-IBM SPSS Modeler

-telco x call data q1.sav

-telco x call data q2.sav

-telco x customer data.xlsx

-telco x products.dat

-telco x tariff.dat

## Workflow Summary

1. Imported all datasets into IBM SPSS Modeler.
2. Appended quarterly call data (Q1 and Q2).
3. Removed duplicates using the Distinct node.
4. Merged with customer, product, and tariff data.
5. Classified gadget information using SetToFlag.
6. Sampled and previewed the final integrated dataset.

## Outcome
